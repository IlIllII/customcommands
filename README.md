# CustomCommands

These are some editor commands that I found useful that didn't yet exist in VSCode. They come unbound so you can map them to whatever keybindings you want.

## Features

The extension provides the following commands:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `goToTop` | Move cursor to the top of the editor viewport. |
| `selectToTop` | Select to the top of the editor viewport. |
| `goToMiddle` | Move cursor to the middle of the editor viewport. |
| `selectToMiddle` | Select to the middle of the editor viewport. |
| `goToBottom` | Move cursor to the bottom of the editor viewport. |
| `selectToBottom` | Select to the bottom of the editor viewport. |
| `goToNextBlankLine` | Move cursor to the next blank line. |
| `selectToNextBlankLine` | Select to the next blank line. |
| `goToPrevBlankLine` | Move cursor to the previous blank line. |
| `selectToPrevBlankLine` | Select to the previous blank line. |
| `centerOnCursor` | Scrolls editor viewport to center the cursor. |
| `deleteBetweenParentheses` | Deletes code inside brackets such as (), {}. []. |
| `indentBlock` | Indents the code block the cursor is currently in. |
| `outdentBlock` | Outdents the code block the cursor is currently in. |

## Requirements
